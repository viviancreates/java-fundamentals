# Steps taken

1. Set up file structure and given class, fields, getters, setters
2. Make media and video class work
   - idfjs
3. djsij

# Notes to self
Initially, I wanted to set up the project based on all specs given so it would be easier to work on having a skeleton of the project
- This is making it overwhelming, also starting to try to work from memory
  - forgot setters 
  - parameters in constructors
- Next time, I would start with just the media abstract class, and one subclass like video
- 
# Questions
- how to decide when setters are needed? added all to skeleton
