# Java Fundamentals

This is my personal space for learning and practicing Java, organized by purpose and topic.

---

## Folders

- [`assessments/`](./assessments)  
  Graded work, summative assessments, and official submissions

- [`demos/`](./demos)  
  Instructor walkthroughs, lecture code, and example-driven projects

- [`mls_exercises/`](./mls_exercises)  
  Assignments from the Apprenti curriculum, organized by topic

- [`notes/`](./notes)  
  Personal notes, breakdowns, and quick references

- [`practice/`](./practice)  
  Exercises, coding drills, and experimental code

## Topics Covered
- Java syntax: variables, primitive types, expressions, methods
- Control flow: conditionals, loops, switch statements
- Object-Oriented Programming: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- Constructors, encapsulation, static vs instance
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Enums and constants
- Collections: List, Map, Set, iteration
- Exception handling: try-catch, throw, custom exceptions
- File I/O: reading and writing files, working with CSVs
- Unit testing with JUnit
- JDBC: database connections and SQL integration
- Command line input/output
- Basic design patterns: factory, command
- Project structure and modularization
- Spring Boot

## Notes to Self
- Use `practice/` for rough work and skill building
- Use `assessments/` as the reference for clean, structured, tested code
- SQL-related files are either in `notes/` or directly tied to assessments
- When stuck, check `demos/` for working patterns and syntax examples

## To Add
- Spring Boot deeper notes
- Finish indexing topics and notes -> table of contents
- Add notes from notion
